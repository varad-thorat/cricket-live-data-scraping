# Live Cricket Matches Score with deploying on Cloud using Firebase Functions

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites
- Node.js:
  1. Go to nodejs.org
  2. Click on the *Download node.js (LTS)
  3. Install the setup
  4. Check it by typing node -v && npm -v in terminal 
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Firebase account (setup a account with blaze plan (pay-as-you-go) , dont worry you wont be charged because only after 2M requests per month it charges you but that wont be for just the case of scraping the data.)
- Create a web app in firebase and copy the firebaseconfig variables which you will need in the extension creation part.

## ðŸš€ Setup Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varad-thorat/cricket-live-data-scraping.git
cd cricket-live-data-scraping
firebase login
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions
(select the firebase project you created and at the end of it, you will be asked to have blaze plan if enabled (just give the card or autopay and select the budget as 0 or 1) then it will be deployed)
